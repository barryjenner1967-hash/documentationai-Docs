title: Introduction To Mind Dump
description: >-
  Mind Dump is your ultimate digital brain, a beautifully adaptable workspace
  designed to capture the chaos of your thoughts and seamlessly transform them
  into crystal-clear action. 

  Rather than forcing you into a rigid organisational structure, it moulds to
  your unique workflow by letting you segregate different areas of your
  life—from daily task lists and web research to comprehensive personal
  CRMs—into dedicated, customised workspaces. 

  By unifying quick-capture notes, seamless email integration, AI-powered
  insights, and dynamic perspectives like mind maps, Kanban boards, and
  calendars, Mind Dump ensures that, whether you are brainstorming a complex
  project or executing today's agenda, your information is always intuitively
  organised and presented in the exact context you need to do your best work.

## **Overview In-Depth**

To achieve this vision, Mind Dump relies on a robust architecture that starts with how your data is structured. At its core, the app allows you to create separate, customisable lists—known as Sessions—that act as independent databases. Depending on your needs, you can set these sessions to be either date-centric for time-sensitive task management or alphabetically driven to build personal knowledge bases and reference libraries. You can then extract and share this information using the highly flexible report builder, which enables you to filter, sort, and group your data to generate customised CSVs, stylised PDFs, or password-protected, publicly shareable links.

### Security

Because your data is your own, Mind Dump prioritises security. It utilises a zero-knowledge, client-side end-to-end encryption (E2E) system, meaning your most sensitive "Secret" custom fields are encrypted in your browser using a passphrase before they ever reach the server. To safely handle your external files, the app features a Google OAuth integration that securely authenticates your account, allowing you to load, embed, and preview private Google Drive documents, spreadsheets, and images directly inside your records.

### Mind Dump Views

Mind Dump’s true power lies in its dynamic presentation layer, which separates your raw data from how you view it. You can seamlessly switch between specialised perspectives to suit your current workflow: The **Kanban Board** lets you drag and drop cards across columns grouped by due dates or your own custom fields; the **Outline View** provides a structured environment for managing complex projects using nested, hierarchical numbering; and the **Mind Map View** allows visual thinkers to explore task relationships and priorities on an expansive, interactive canvas. When it is time to execute on those plans, the **Calendar View** empowers you to map out your day directly from your task lists. You can drag unscheduled tasks onto an hourly grid to time-block your agenda, manage overdue items, and print daily or weekly schedules to keep yourself on track.

### The Scratch Pad for Quick-Capture

To ensure friction never gets in the way of capturing a thought, Mind Dump features the **Scratch Pad**. This quick-capture tool allows you to instantly save fleeting notes, extract URLs, or paste directly from your computer's clipboard. These items are held in a processing queue, ready for you to review them and convert them into structured tasks or subtasks later.

### Email Integration

Your communications are also seamlessly integrated. Mind Dump includes a full IMAP/SMTP **Email System** that allows you to read, reply to, and forward messages directly within the app. You can effortlessly link emails to existing task notes or convert incoming messages into brand-new tasks with a single click. For those who process information spatially, the **Email Mind Map** feature visualises your inbox. It maps out your last 7 days of emails—or historical archives—as an interactive bilateral tree, allowing visual workers to instantly grasp unread threads and gain structural insights into their communications.

### Bookmarks and CMS View

Mind Dump also brings order to the wider web. The **Bookmarks** feature works in tandem with a dedicated browser extension to let you save web pages on the fly. It transforms your saved links into a beautiful, highly visual bookmarks dashboard that is accessible from any device, making web navigation and research significantly easier. When you simply want to read or reference your data without the clutter of task management controls, the **CMS View** (Content Management System) offers an uncomplicated, beautiful reading experience, displaying your knowledge bases as clean folder cards and clipboard-style records.

### The Form Builder

The ecosystem even extends to external collaborators through the **Form Builder**. This feature allows you to design custom data intake forms and embed them on external websites or share them via URLs. This means clients, colleagues, or friends can add data directly into your designated Mind Dump sessions without ever needing an account or logging into the app.

### Integrated but Optional AI

Finally, Mind Dump offers powerful **AI Assistant** capabilities. You can connect with Anthropic Claude or Google Gemini to analyse your sessions, chat about your projects, generate daily digests, or draft content directly inside your task notes. However, this AI integration is designed strictly as an optional enhancement; Mind Dump remains a fiercely capable and fully functional information manager whether you choose to use the AI features or not.
