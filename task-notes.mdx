title: 'Task Notes: Building a Timeline of Context'
---
While Custom Fields are perfect for storing structured, specific data (like a currency amount or a due date), sometimes you need a place to capture free-flowing thoughts, updates, or extended context over time. This is where **Task Notes** come in.

#### The Purpose of Notes

Each task in Mind Dump can have multiple independent notes attached to it. These notes are intended to provide additional, independent, but directly associated textual entities.

You might wonder: *Why not just add a "Textarea" Custom Field to the session and type my notes there?*

While you certainly could use a Textarea field, unstructured ongoing updates can quickly become muddled in a single text box. If you are tracking a long-running project or a client relationship, writing paragraph after paragraph into one field makes it difficult to parse out *when* a specific update occurred or *what* it was about.

Task Notes solve this by providing a convenient means of adding many separate, distinct textual entries. Every time you add a new note, Mind Dump automatically stamps it with its own creation date and time flag (and tracks when it was last updated). This transforms a static task into a dynamic, chronological activity stream.

#### Accessing Task Notes

Mind Dump makes it incredibly easy to jump into a task's notes without interrupting your workflow. You can access the notes interface in two primary ways:

1. **The Notes Icon:** In the Standard View (as well as Kanban and Outline views), any task that contains notes will display a small Notes icon (📝) directly on its card, accompanied by a number indicating exactly how many notes are attached. Clicking this badge opens the Notes interface immediately.

2. **The Control Panel / Edit Modal:** You can also access notes by clicking the 3-dot (⋮) menu on a task to open the Task Control Panel and selecting the **"📝 Notes"** option, or by accessing them through the comprehensive View/Edit Details modal.

#### Using the Notes Modal

When you open the Notes feature, you are presented with a dedicated modal designed specifically for managing that task's activity stream.

This modal provides a clean list of all existing notes associated with the task. From this interface, you can:

- **Add New Notes:** Quickly type a subject title and your extended content to add a brand-new entry to the timeline.

- **View Existing Notes:** Scroll through the chronological history of updates, complete with date flags showing exactly when each note was created or modified.

- **Edit and Delete:** If you made a mistake or a note is no longer relevant, you can easily open a note to edit its contents (using the ✏️ icon) or permanently delete it (using the 🗑️ icon) right from the list.
