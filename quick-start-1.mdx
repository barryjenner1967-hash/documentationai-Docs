  Mind Dump is a web-based application, so no downloads or installations are required. Simply use any device with internet access. Mind Dump is designed to work with smaller mobile displays, but the expansive nature of the app will make using smaller screens more challenging. We recommend you usually work on a tablet or PC type computer.

## Quick Start: Your First Steps in Mind Dump

Welcome to Mind Dump! This guide will take you step-by-step from your very first login to creating your first task, giving you a quick tour of the workspace along the way.

**Step 1: Your First Login** When you first open the application, you will be greeted by the login window. Simply enter your **Username** and **Password**. If you are on a personal device, you can check the **"Keep me logged in for 7 days"** box so you don't have to sign in every time you visit. Click the **Login** button to proceed.

**Step 2: Creating Your First Session** Immediately after your first successful login, the system will ask you to create your first session, offering the default name **"My First Session"**. You can accept this or type in a different name.

This initial session is created as a basic **Date Centric** session. "Date Centric" simply means that the session will be ordered and managed by time. This structure is incredibly useful for standard task management functions or any workflow where dates and deadlines are an essential part of the process. *(Note: Mind Dump supports several other powerful session types—we invite you to look at the dedicated documentation explaining Sessions to learn more &#x20;*[*Click Here*](sessions)*).*

**Step 3: Re-Logging In** Once your session is created, the screen will clear and you will be asked to log in one more time. Don't worry, this is a usual part of the initial setup process to ensure your new workspace is securely loaded.

**Step 4: Exploring the Standard View** After logging in again, you will be presented with the **Standard View**. Let's quickly break down the layout of your screen:&#x20;

- **The Side Bar:** Located on the left, this is where many of the app's navigation and view controls are located. We will go through each of these functions later in the documentation.

**The Information Bar:** Running along the top of the view, this bar changes dynamically during operation to show you important context and information.&#x20;

- **The Task Entry Bar:** Located just below the information bar, this is your primary tool for capturing thoughts. It features:

  - A text entry box that automatically expands when you click into it. This is used for the Artificial Intelligence task entry system, which we will explore in detail later.

  - A **"Send To Mind Dump"** button, which processes the text you typed using the AI assistant.

  - An **"Enter Direct Task"** button.

**Step 5: Entering Your First Task** We are going to enter our first item manually using the direct entry method. Click the **Enter Direct Task** button.

An entry modal will appear in the center of your screen. Because this session has just been created, it is in its most basic form and includes the following standard fields:

- **Task Name:** The name or description of your task. Examples for a Date Centric session might be *'Pick up milk'*, *'Put the dustbin out'*, or *'Prepare for the sales meeting'*.

- **Due Date:** (Optional but recommended for Date Centric Tasks). This is when the task needs to be completed. You can use the provided calendar picker to select a specific day.

  - **Priority (Optional) :** Allows you to flag a task's level of importance. You can leave it as the default "Normal", or visually highlight it by selecting "🔥 Urgent" or "🟧 Not Urgent".

  - **Time Estimate (Optional):** A dropdown menu that lets you predict how long the task will take. Options range from quick 10-minute intervals up to a "Full day".

  - **Initial Note (Optional):** A larger text area where you can add any extra details, instructions, or expanded thoughts related to the task right from the start.

  Once you have filled out your desired fields, simply click the **"💾 Add Task"** button at the bottom of the modal.

  The modal will close, and your newly created task will immediately appear in your Standard View list, ready for you to manage!
